# ITC Stock Price Analysis & Prediction (2000â€“2021)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes 21 years of ITC Ltd. stock data (2000â€“2021) to uncover trends, seasonality, and volatility patterns, followed by building predictive machine learning models for price forecasting.

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed historical OHLCV data to identify long-term trends, seasonal effects, and volatility clusters.
- Visualized moving averages, price distributions, and volume trends.
- Detected key historical events affecting price movement.

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models
1. **Monthly Price Prediction**
   - Model: Regression (XGBoost/Linear Regression)
   - Target: End-of-month price prediction.
   - Performance: **RÂ² Score = 72%**
2. **Next-Day Price Direction**
   - Model: Classification (Logistic Regression/Random Forest)
   - Target: Predict if next dayâ€™s closing price will go **up** or **down**.
   - Performance: **Accuracy â‰ˆ 50%**.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost
- **Data Source**: Historical ITC Ltd. stock prices

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Successfully identified trends and market patterns through EDA.
- Achieved strong predictive performance for monthly prices.
